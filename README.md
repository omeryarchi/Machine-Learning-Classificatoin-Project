# Machine-Learning-Data-Analysis-Project
In this project I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn for binary classificatoin of an around 22,000 rows X 22 columns data.
 
The project has 5 main parts:

Part 1 - Data Exploration: in this part I explored the data and the different features, and searched for correlation between features.

Part 2 - Preprocessing: Outliers, Data normalization, Taking care of empty/null values, PCA method, Feature Selection

Part 3 - Models: Built 4 different models: KNN, Logistic Regression, ANN, Random Forest

Part 4 - Models Evaluation: Here I evaluate the models to find the best one to fit the data (by Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Overfitting)

Part 5 - Prediction
